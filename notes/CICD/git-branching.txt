in the same directory in terminal 
(1)  git checkout -b devel
branch will be switched to devel

now we need to push the code ... like git push origin devel 

now in the github repo 
go to pull requests section 
click on the new pull request 
and  enter create pull request from compare devel to base master (base: master <- compare devel)
and then write comments and crate pull request

github testing workflow will start
after merging, 

it will be a push to main branch 
and deployment workflow will start in actions tab


-- Coming Back to Main Branch 

1st git add .
git commit -m "" 
git checkout main
git push origin main 

if some error occurs in pushing code .. i will have to pull the code first 
git pull origin main 
then git add commit and push
