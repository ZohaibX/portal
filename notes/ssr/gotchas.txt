redirection again to the page we were redirected from:-
      whenever we redirect the user from HOCs, Redirect all properties work in the pag, we are redirected to.
      properties like <Redirect to={{pathname , search , hash}}/> works
      but when we do <Redirect to={{pathname: '/signIn',state: { from: location }}} />
      pathname property works, but state property is always undefined 


dynamic routes:-
      routes like path="/signIn" works
      but path="/auth/signIn" shows error in console
