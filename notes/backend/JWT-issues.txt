Authorization problem -- 

if a user gets a jwt token and after that, admin bans that user 
that user will have the token already and he can do anything with that token

so, we have to have a system that when admin bans the user 
event bus will execute an event and tell every service to not let him access the service
this event will be stored in the service for a smaller time until token gets expired by itself

if we have set to expire the token after 15 minutes of its creation  
then that event will be stored in the service for 15 minute and will not let him access the service for 15 mins
