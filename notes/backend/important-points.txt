  
=> We have Auth Module very good

=> test folder/ setup.ts file mast hai
   pre setup for testing 
   global.signUp() fn is changed for auth srv in setup.ts

=> mock methods for nats connection and stripe connection are defined
   stripe connection is defined in setup.ts of payments srv
   so they don't use actual connections 

=> expiration srv is defined 
   to store the time, user has left. to pay for the order 

==> when creating an order , we will assign it time, for example 15 minutes 
    we will tell expiration srv that an order is created 
    expiration service will findout how much time, order has assigned 
    and right after 15 minutes (or the time we have assigned )
    expiration srv's listener will publish a msg to orders srv, that expiration is done
    then, order srv will decide that order is payed or not 

==> Ref is used in orders model -- to have a reference of ticket object

==> Stripe is used in Payments/new.ts and more details are in 
    stripe repo
