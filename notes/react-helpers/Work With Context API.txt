IN context module .. we have createContext and context.provider method ..
then we'll wrap a main root of a tree component with (R)
Then in every component related to the root .. i can use useContext(createContext(export)) and destructure the state and state updating functions ..

i can use useState Hook to create a state 
can use useEffect to make  a lifecycle .. and i can find out how to use that with cdm
