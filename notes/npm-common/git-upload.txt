npm module may not be uploaded to github with whole project -- 

if we go to npm module thru termial
it will be master branch

i can undo git init -- as --- rm -rf .git
then master should be shifted to main --
then i should do --- git rm --cached . -rf

and then do git add commit push from the npm module -- to the github whole project
