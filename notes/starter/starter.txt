Backend:::::::::::---------
We must use TDD approach 
All Images must be deployed to dockerhub when deploying the code 

packages 
  typescript ts-node-dev express @types/express cors body-parser


TS
  tsc --init -> to generate tsconfig.json
  change in start script

Points :-
  Create a very first directory for any service like auth..
  and just do some basics with any basic route.. 
  tsconfig .dockerignore  Dockerfile package.json 
  test_folder(where special test code is located) index.ts and app.ts (from this project or so )
  copy services folder and do required changes 
  Must!! change name of the project in package.json and include exclude npm modules
  do yarn install
  do the changes in the copied files to exclude errors
  Build Image and push to docker hub (push if possible)  
  create depl.yaml file and copy from previous micro-service and change the service names  
  create mongo-depl file and copy from previous micro service and change the service names 
  add persitent volume claim if necessary
  create or update ingress-service
  add the service to ingress-service
  create or update skaffold.yaml, and do skaffold dev in terminal
  go to src/test/setup.ts and change the global.signIn fn (auth service setup is changed than others) 

and then host will be online 

Frontend:::::::::::::-------------

yarn create next-app client  
tsc --init -> to generate tsconfig.json
follow the link to add ts --> https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript
after setting next js -- create Dockerfile and docker ignore file 
build and PUSH the image  (push it is not mandatory in dev mode (if not having good internet)) 
then we have 3 things to do, add this service in k8s depl file, ingress srv file and Skaffold 

//!! must run this on skaffold dev , not on local env

add next.config.js file from here
